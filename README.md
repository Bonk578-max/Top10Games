 // Made a list about my top 10 games, and keantes games.

// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Lucas Guptill: website is a little hard to understand but other than that the buttons work to take you to each persons list. I like the coloring for the nav bar. Only recommendation would be to add some information about each game or number them 1-10 but other than that great work!
